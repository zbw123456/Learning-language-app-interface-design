# LingualLearn: Language Learning App

*Developed as part of Human-Computer Interaction coursework at University of Trento*

## Overview

LingualLearn is a mobile application designed specifically for busy adult learners in the EU who want to study languages during their fragmented leisure time. Unlike traditional language learning platforms, LingualLearn emphasizes short, goal-driven sessions that fit around work schedules while supporting both structured progress and spontaneous engagement.

## Key Features

- **Micro-learning sessions** optimized for 15-30 minute study periods
- **Smart vocabulary planning** with spaced repetition algorithm
- **Pronunciation feedback** with voice recognition technology
- **Offline functionality** for learning on the go
- **Multi-device synchronization** across iOS, Android and web platforms
- **Visual progress tracking** with gamification elements (streaks, badges)
- **Context-aware suggestions** based on time, location and learning history

## Research Insights

Based on surveys with 50+ European adult learners:
- 68% study vocabulary 2-6 times per week
- 74% prefer sessions under 30 minutes
- 65% learn 1-10 new words per session
- Most valued features: spaced repetition, visual progress tracking, and offline access

## Design Approach

LingualLearn was developed following a user-centered design process:
- Comprehensive benchmarking of existing solutions
- User research through surveys and interviews
- PACT analysis (People, Activities, Contexts, Technologies)
- Iterative prototyping and usability testing
- Focus on familiar interaction patterns to reduce cognitive load

## Target Audience

Busy EU adults aged 19-35 who:
- Have full-time work or study commitments
- Value personal and professional development
- Prefer learning in micro-moments (commutes, breaks)
- Seek structured progress with flexibility

## Prototype

The project includes low and medium-fidelity prototypes demonstrating core functionality:
- Vocabulary learning with image/audio prompts
- Progress tracking and statistics
- Offline content management
- Personalized goal setting

## Future Directions

Potential enhancements include:
- Advanced gamification that motivates without distraction
- Dynamic goal adaptation based on user behavior
- Community features for social learning
- Integration with external learning resources
